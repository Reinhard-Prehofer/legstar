XML Schema Annotator (xsdcgen) overview

  LegStar xsdcgen adds cobol-related meta-data to an XML schema.
  
  The meta-data is added to the input XML schema as standard XML Schema annotations
  producing an annotated XML schema.
  
  The resulting cobol annotations can then be processed by the {{{../legstar-jaxbgen} JAXB Generator}}
  to produce a set of annotated JAXB classes that can, in-turn, be used to marshal/unmarshal
  host data.
  
  Xsdcgen is typically used when host programs need to consume remote web services. In this
  use-case, Xsdcgen will process the schema data from the target web service WSDL.
  
  Xsdcgen is an ant task which takes as input either an XML schema or a WSDL file.
