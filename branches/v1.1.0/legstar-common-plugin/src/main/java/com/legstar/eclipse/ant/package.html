    Defines a logger to work with AntRunner in order to direct the output of ant
    projects to a console. This code must be packaged in its own jar file and
    has to be loaded by ant. This last constraint means the jar file must be
    copied to: window-->preferences-->ant-->runtime-->global entries.<br>
