<title>WSDL/XSD Structures Mapping</title>
<para>
  The process starts by mapping XML schema types, from the target Web Service WSDL, to COBOL data items.
</para>
<para>
  You can use the <emphasis>build-xsd2xsd.xml</emphasis> ant script from the
  samples/quickstarts/proxy_ws_cultureinfo folder as your starting point.
</para>
<para>
  The script executes a single ant task, xsdcgen, which can process WSDL or XML Schema as input to
  produce a new XML Schema with COBOL annotations.

  Assuming you want to customize <emphasis>build-xsd2xsd.xml</emphasis> for the Microsoft LIVE search
  SOAP service. Follow these steps:

  Make sure the classpath setting for the xsdcgen task is correct.
  The fileset should point to the location where you installed LegStar.

<para>
  The inputXsdUri is the location of your input WSDL or XML Schema. In the case of
  Microsoft LIVE Web Service you can use:
  <ulink url="http://soap.search.msn.com/webservices.asmx?wsdl">http://soap.search.msn.com/webservices.asmx?wsdl</ulink> 
</para>

<para>
  The targetDir and targetXsdFileName parameters should point to the location
  and name you would like for the new XML Schema with COBOL annotations.

  For a complete list of options for the xsdcgen task, you can refer to
  <ulink url="http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-xsdcgen/apidocs/com/legstar/xsdc/gen/XsdCobolAnnotator.html">XsdCobolAnnotator</ulink>.
</para>
<para>
  After you run the script, you should get a new XML Schema file with the name you specified.
</para>
<para>
  Open this file and notice that each root Elements and Complex Types in the WSDL source
  has been mapped to a COBOL data item.
  Each Schema type has COBOL annotations that serves as mapping meta-data for other tools.
</para>
<para>
  Since we started from a WSDL, a certain number of default COBOL data attributes were assigned. For instance,
  all character strings are 32 characters long. While this might be an acceptable default, it is not always
  the case. In our situation, the application ID (AppID) must be 40 characters long. We need to change
  the COBOL picture from X(32) to X(40).
