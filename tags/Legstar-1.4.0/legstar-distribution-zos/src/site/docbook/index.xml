<title>Distribution for z/OS overview</title>
<para>
  This is a distribution of all LegStar z/OS modules in TSO XMIT format.
</para>
<para>
  Although the main <ulink url="http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-distribution">LegStar distribution</ulink> contains all the
  z/OS modules as source code and sample compilation JCL, it might be tricky to figure out in what
  precise order these compilation jobs should run. In addition, the main distribution does not
  include JCL for CICS RDO definitions.
</para>
<para>
  As a convenience, this distribution groups all z/OS modules both in executable and source
  format in a set of TSO XMIT files. This way, you can install the executables directly without
  any compilation. Furthermore a JCL with RDO definitions is provided.
