        The Structures Mapping Generator takes an additional parameter to collect the JAXB Classes name prefix.

        as default values next time the plugin is used.

        Issue 23. Added a Maven-based update mechanism for all Eclipse Plugin version-dependent PDE resources.
        MANIFEST.MF files and build.properties files are generated to reflect the Maven versions.
        Features and Sites are now Maven controlled (Although Maven still does not create the Eclipse distributables).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed the binding generator plugin: When a root element has a named complex type it was shown twice creating confusion.
        Furthermore, selecting the element instead of the type was leading the binding generator to fail looking
        for the wrong create method in the jaxb object factory.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed issue with New Operations Mapping plugin which was raising an NPE when no project is selected in the Package Explorer.
