    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-07-08" description="Minor changes">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed an issue reported by NWA with certain keywords (TO, IS, ...) that the parser
        was missing when they were in lowercase. 
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Does not generate JAXB global bindings anymore. The JAXB COBOL Annotator now comes
        with an external binding file that does that. 
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The schema generator now shares model and tasks inherited from codegen with other
        schema generators. Normalizing ant task properties leads to various deprecated
        properties. Schema generator also now includes a velocity template for ant script
        generation in support for the schema generator Eclipse plugin.
