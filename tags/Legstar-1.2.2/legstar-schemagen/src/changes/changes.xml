    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-11-15" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The COBOL Schema generator now accepts a jaxbTypeClassesSuffix parameter. The string value
        passed in this parameter is used to suffix all Complex Type names.
        There was a default prefix of "Type" in previous versions. It is important to note that this
        is not the case anymore starting with 1.2.2 (the default for jaxbTypeClassesSuffix is no suffix).

        Fixed an issue reported by NWA with certain keywords (TO, IS, ...) that the parser
        was missing when they were in lowercase.

      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Does not generate JAXB global bindings anymore. The JAXB COBOL Annotator now comes
        with an external binding file that does that.

      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The schema generator now shares model and tasks inherited from codegen with other
        schema generators. Normalizing ant task properties leads to various deprecated
        properties. Schema generator also now includes a velocity template for ant script
        generation in support for the schema generator Eclipse plugin.
