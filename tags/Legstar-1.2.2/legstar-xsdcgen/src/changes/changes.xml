    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-11-15" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The XSD and Java Schema generators default value for the jaxbTypeClassesSuffix parameter
        has changed starting with 1.2.2. It used to be "Type", it is no suffix starting from now.
        The reason for this change is that the JAXB classes we were generating were not
        compatible with the one generated by third party tools.

        A new j2sc Ant task takes standard Java classes as input and generates
        COBOL-annotated XML schemas. This is an alternative to the xsdc Ant
        task that takes XML schema or WSDL as input.
