Invoker overview

  The LegStar Invoker provides a general purpose remote invokation mechanism for host programs.
  
  The Invoker receives input structures as JAXB object trees and produces output JAXB object
  trees. The HostInvoker has the capability to call single input/single output program such as
  CICS commarea-driven programs but it can also call multiple input/multiple output programs
  such as CICS containers-driven programs.
  
  Invoker uses the {{{../legstar-coxbrt} COBOL to XML Binding}} classes to marshal/unmarshal
  host data buffers.
  
  Host programs to call are described by properties files such as the lsfileae.properties
  sample file provided. Such a properties file is expected to be available from the classpath.
  
  The Invoker expects a configuration file as well as a target address to run the host
  program on. A configuration file is an XML file. The Invoker looks for host endpoint
  definitions similar to the one found in the legstar-invoker-config.xml sample provided.
  
  The Address received by the invoker specifies which host enpoint to use. If the Address
  is empty, the first endpoint definition is used. The Address can also override host
  credentials.
  
  Two host access strategies are provided: direct and pooled. With a direct access strategy, 
  there are no intermediate engines, clients connect to the host directly. With the pooled
  access strategy, an {{{../legstar-engine} engine}} manages a pool of connections.
  
  The strategy chosen is configurable at the host endpoint level in the configuration file.
  
  To select a direct access strategy you would add the following element:

+-------------------------------+
		<hostAccessStrategy>direct</hostAccessStrategy>
+-------------------------------+
  
  For a pooled access strategy, the element would be:

+-------------------------------+
		<hostAccessStrategy>pooled</hostAccessStrategy>
+-------------------------------+
   
  The host access strategy is independent from the underlying transport.
  
  Pooling allows host connections to be reused. For details, refer to {{{../legstar-engine} LegStar engine}}.
