    <release version="1.2.6" date="2009-07-30" description="Fixes and performances release">
        <action dev="fady" type="update">
            Fixed issue 56: Inconsistent JAXB/JAX-WS annotations for JAX-WS adapters.
        </action>
        <action dev="fady" type="update">
            Fixed issue 59: Replace adapter program properties file with bean.
        </action>
        <action dev="fady" type="update">
            Fixed issue 63: Adapters can now be deployed to AXIS2 in addition to JAX-WS RI (Metro).
        </action>
        <action dev="fady" type="update">
            There is a new distribution folder that is used at generation time to receive jar and war archives.
            The generator produces a separate deploy.xml ant script to deploy to the J2EE server.
        </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.5" date="2009-05-30" description="Fixes release">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed issue 50: Remove systematic final attributes on methods.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed issue 51: Remove static attribute on commons logging logger .
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.4" date="2009-03-30" description="Performance release">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Changed some velocity templates so that they can be reused for other targets (ESBs...).
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.3" date="2009-01-30" description="Refactoring Proxy Runtime">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Reimplemented the JAX-WS endpoint implementation using the new Transformer API.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Issue 3: The generated COBOL samples now have a start level of 2
        and incrementation of 1 for their data description items.
        This should allow handling deep structures (up to 24 levels actually).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Issue 8: Cixsgen now supports target POJO for proxies (in addition to Web Services).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Issue 6: Supports multiple COBOL sample HTTP clients (LSHTTAPI, DFHWBCLI, WEBAPI).
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-11-15" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Changed the sample COBOL CICS client so that it is consistent with the ones generated for JBoss ESB.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The war build template was assuming the service name is part of the web service implementation package name.
        This is usually not true. This fixes the issue but assumes there is always a package name when,
        in theory (never tested), one could generate an implementation without a package name.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Certain templates were referencing the mainframe program properties file using the CixsOperation name where
        it should be the lowercased program name.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.2.1" date="2008-09-30" description="Code cleansing">
    </release>

    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-07-08" description="Velocity macros and Proxies generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        The Generator can now produce Web Service proxies for mainframe clients. These
        can be deployed with the legstar-c2wsrt runtime to provide mainframe programs
        with the ability to call oubound Web Services.
        In this case, the generator produces a Servlet and a COBOL sample client.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The XSLT based generation has been replaced by Velocity macros. The code is
        easier to maintain and performances are better.
        There is a new legstar-cixsgen-model project that isolates classes that are
        common to multiple target platforms (Jaxws, Mule, ...).
        The Ant Task has been renamed Jaxws2CixsGenerator to show the dependency on
        Jaxws. There are also minor changes in the Task properties so old Ant script
        may break with this new version.
        Test cases have been revised and are more thorough.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.1.0" date="2007-08-30" description="CICS Containers support">
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        Operations now support multiple inputs and multiple outputs where each input or
        output structure maps to a different JAXB object and also to a CICS Container.
      </action>
    </release>
    
    <release version="1.0.1" date="2007-04-20" description="Transport/Connectivity refactoring">
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        Generated endpoints now use a new XML configuration file. It is called legstar-invoker-config.xml
        and should be accessible from the classpath (for instance stored in shared/classes).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        Generated endpoints are protocol agnostic. You can switch from http to socket and
        have both direct or pooled sessions to CICS by changing the XML configuration file.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="remove">
        The Hostconnection.properties file no longer exist. It is not referenced from the
        generated endpoints anymore (content is replaced by XML configuration file).
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="0.0.1" date="2006-12-31" description="First release">
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        First version of the generator.
