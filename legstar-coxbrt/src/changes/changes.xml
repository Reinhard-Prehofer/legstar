    </release>
    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-07-08" description="Binding to POJO">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        It is now possible to bind directly to a POJO rather than a JAXB class. The JAXB classes
        are still needed at generation time but not at runtime anymore.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.1.0" date="2007-08-30" description="Refactoring and creation of coxbapi">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Package "com.legstar.host" has been renamed "com.legstar.coxb.host" and moved to
        the coxbapi project.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Visitor classes have been moved from package "com.legstar.host" to "com.legstar.coxb.visitor".
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Package "com.legstar.coxb.rt" has been removed. Classes in "com.legstar.coxb.impl" provide
        runtime functionalities.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        Binding classes now implement a "calcByteLength" method to evaluate the maximum host data
        buffer length needed for marshaling. The "getByteLength" method now returns zero for group
        items.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Binding classes now have a constructor which takes the JAXB object as its sole argument.
        The constructors that used to take the JAXB object factory as a parameter have been
        removed (the binding class has a private property pointing to this object factory now).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Binding classes do not have a "getJaxbObject" anymore. Instead, they implement a "getxxx"
        method where xxx is the underlying JAXB object name.
      </action>
