    <release version="1.1.0" date="2007-05-25" description="CICS Containers support">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The Web Service dialog displays different items in support for multiple input
        and output operations. Individual input and output structures are not shown, only
        the number of them appears.
        The endpoint package and target namespace for the Service endpoint are now
        modifiable.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The Operations dialog now displays a table of input and a table of output
        structures. Each table has a set of Add/Edit/Remove buttons. An operation can
        also specify a CICS Channel.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        The Structure dialog maps JAXB objects to inputs and outputs. It also allows
        a JAXB object to map a CICS Container. 
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The service descriptor format has changed. It used to be a simple properties file,
        it is now an XML with the same Schema as the inner object expected by the cixsgen
        ANT task and also the CIXS Generator XML descriptor used as input to the XSLT code
        generation process. In other words, there is now a single XML Schema to represent
        XSLT input to code generation, ANT task inner object and Eclipse plugin model.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        build-service.template is now used to generate the ANT task. This has replaced the
        build-service.xml file that used to serve as a template.
       </action>
