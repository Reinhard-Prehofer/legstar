    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-04-01" description="Velocity macros">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        You can now provide multiple Jaxb root class names for a single execution
        of the binding generator.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The binding generator now accepts to bind to a Java class that is different from
        the JAXB class. In such a case, the JAXB class is only used at generation time.
        At generation time the Java class to bind with, is extracted from a special
        annotation called CobolComplexType.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The XSLT based generation has been replaced by Velocity macros. The code is
        easier to maintain and performances are better.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The JAXB generation now takes an external bindings file in order for all
        generated JAXB implementation classes to be serializable.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.1.0" date="2007-08-30" description="XSL and API refactoring">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The generation XSL has been simplified and the generated classes now use
        the new Cobol binding API so that generated classes do not directly depend
        on a particular binding impementation.
