Distribution overview

  For a general introduction to LegStar, click {{{../index.html} here}}.

  The distribution project merges LegStar modules into a single assembly. By downloading
  the distribution, you don't need to individually download the various LegStar modules.
  
  The distribution does not contain the Eclipse plugins though which are expected to
  be installed using the standard Eclipse update mechanism.
  
  The distribution also provides source code for the current release as well as access
  to previous releases downloads.
