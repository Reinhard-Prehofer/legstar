    <release version="1.2.4" date="2009-03-30" description="Performance release">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The COBOL binding XML schema namespace has been changed to reflect modifications in handling of byteLength and value attributes.
        The new namespace is http://www.legsem.com/legstar/xml/cobol-binding-1.0.1.xsd and it exists at this location.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Pure DBCS fields (PIC G, DISPLAY-1) are now supported properly. They map to Strings (not byte[] anymore).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fields with VALUE SPACES are no longer initialized with an actual string of spaces.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.3" date="2009-01-30" description="Refactoring Proxy Runtime">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed issue 26: When 2 complex types from the same COBOL fragment have name conflicts,
        the schema generator now appends the original source line number to create a unique type name.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-11-15" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The COBOL Schema generator now accepts a jaxbTypeClassesSuffix parameter. The string value
        passed in this parameter is used to suffix all Complex Type names.
        There was a default prefix of "Type" in previous versions. It is important to note that this
        is not the case anymore starting with 1.2.2 (the default for jaxbTypeClassesSuffix is no suffix).

    <release version="1.2.1" date="2008-09-30" description="Code cleansing">
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-07-08" description="Minor changes">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed an issue reported by NWA with certain keywords (TO, IS, ...) that the parser
        was missing when they were in lowercase. 
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Does not generate JAXB global bindings anymore. The JAXB COBOL Annotator now comes
        with an external binding file that does that. 
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The schema generator now shares model and tasks inherited from codegen with other
        schema generators. Normalizing ant task properties leads to various deprecated
        properties. Schema generator also now includes a velocity template for ant script
        generation in support for the schema generator Eclipse plugin.
