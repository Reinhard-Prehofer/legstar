    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-11-15" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Added a corruption check on receiving data from the mainframe plus a test case.
        This is because there is now possibility that the mainframe be sending raw
        data rather than architected legStar messages.

      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Main classes were renamed from MessageXxx to LegStarMessageXxx. This was necessary
        because several third party products were using similar class names causing
        conflicts.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Some classes were moved into a new messaging-impl project so that messaging could
        stay agnostic from implementation details.
