    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-11-15" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixing legstar-jbossesb issue 3: was unable to attach source or javadoc to LegStar library containers jars.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Issue 24: Finish button was enabled on first page of multipage wizards as soon as the page
        was valid. This is often too early as mandatory parameters are collected on subsequent pages.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Issue 22 : Operation mapping plugin: Clicking on add structure and returning without adding one result in this
        invalid record: input coxbType="nullBinding" coxbPackageName="null.bind".
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        The Structures Mapping Generator takes an additional parameter to collect the JAXB Classes name prefix.
        Field values entered on the generator are stored in the preferences store so that they are presented
        as default values next time the plugin is used.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Issue 23. Added a Maven-based update mechanism for all Eclipse Plugin version-dependent PDE resources.
        MANIFEST.MF files and build.properties files are generated to reflect the Maven versions.
        Features and Sites are now Maven controlled (Although Maven still does not create the Eclipse distributables).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed the binding generator plugin: When a root element has a named complex type it was shown twice creating confusion.
        Furthermore, selecting the element instead of the type was leading the binding generator to fail looking
        for the wrong create method in the jaxb object factory.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed issue with New Operations Mapping plugin which was raising an NPE when no project is selected in the Package Explorer.
