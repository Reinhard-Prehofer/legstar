    <release version="1.2.4" date="2009-03-30" description="Performance release">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed issue 44: Marshaler should initialize all items of a fixed sized complex array when the bound value object is
        empty of partially filled.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Added XML to Host transformers based on reflection.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Removed byteLength from the expected java annotations. The calculation is done at generation time.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.3" date="2009-01-30" description="Refactoring Proxy Runtime">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Added support for Transformers and the new associated API.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Issue 29: When mainframe sends partial data, converters should  produce default values or use the partial data 
        when it is available.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixing Issue 28:  COBOL Binding class does not compile for arrays with OCCURS 0 TO 1.
        The case OCCURS 0 TO 1 DEPENDING ON is now managed as an optional element (not an array).
        The counter element in DEPENDING ON will be set to 1 if object exist and conversely,
        host data is assumed to contain bytes for that element if the associated counter is 1.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.2" date="2008-12-01" description="Support for ESB generation">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Bug 30: String padding character now depends on target host character set rather than being hardcoded as 0x40.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Fixed Bug 31: Zoned decimals are now considered as characters and are translated to the target host character set.
        This opens the possibility that the target character set be ASCII rather than EBCDIC.
        An important restriction is that COBOL decimals must be unsigned or explicitly declared with SIGN IS SEPARATE if the
        target character set is not EBCDIC.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Changed code due to removal of "Type" as the default jaxbTypeClassesSuffix in XML schema generation.
        JAXB test class names are not suffixed with "Type" anymore.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.1" date="2008-09-30" description="Code cleansing">
    </release>
    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-07-08" description="Binding to POJO">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        It is now possible to bind directly to a POJO rather than a JAXB class. The JAXB classes
        are still needed at generation time but not at runtime anymore.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.1.0" date="2007-08-30" description="Refactoring and creation of coxbapi">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Package "com.legstar.host" has been renamed "com.legstar.coxb.host" and moved to
        the coxbapi project.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Visitor classes have been moved from package "com.legstar.host" to "com.legstar.coxb.visitor".
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Package "com.legstar.coxb.rt" has been removed. Classes in "com.legstar.coxb.impl" provide
        runtime functionalities.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="add">
        Binding classes now implement a "calcByteLength" method to evaluate the maximum host data
        buffer length needed for marshaling. The "getByteLength" method now returns zero for group
        items.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Binding classes now have a constructor which takes the JAXB object as its sole argument.
        The constructors that used to take the JAXB object factory as a parameter have been
        removed (the binding class has a private property pointing to this object factory now).
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Binding classes do not have a "getJaxbObject" anymore. Instead, they implement a "getxxx"
        method where xxx is the underlying JAXB object name.
      </action>
