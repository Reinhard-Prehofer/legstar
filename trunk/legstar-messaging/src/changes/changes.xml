    <release version="1.2.0" date="2008-07-08" description="Refactoring">
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Main classes were renamed from MessageXxx to LegStarMessageXxx. This was necessary
        because several third party products were using similar class names causing
        conflicts.
      </action>
      <action dev="fady" type="update">
        Some classes were moved into a new messaging-impl project so that messaging could
        stay agnostic from implementation details.
