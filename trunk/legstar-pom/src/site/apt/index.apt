Overview

  LegStar is the first open-source initiative in the domain of legacy application integration.
  
  To get a general idea of LegStar, you can read the {{{./pdf/legstar-presentation.pdf}presentation document}}.
    
  LegStar is based on a {{{legstar-schemagen/xml/legstarschemagen.xsd}COBOL binding language}}
  to describe how COBOL data items should map to XML Schema elements.
  
  LegStar offers {{{legstar-coxbapi/}COBOL Binding API}} marshaling/unmarshaling capabilities. This feature
  is built on top of the standard {{{http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222}JAXB framework}}
  which provides Java to XML binding. As a result of this combination, LegStar can convert z/OS data buffers
  to XML and vice versa.
  
  LegStar also provides mapping of {{{legstar-cixsgen/index.html}Web Service Generator}}.
  This feature is an implementation of the standard {{{http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=224}JAXWS}}
  Web Service API. This allows you to expose legacy CICS programs as Web Services.
  
  Because LegStar uses the JAXWS standard framework you benefit from the latest advances in SOA.
  
  In addition to the code-first approach to integration where you would start with a tool such as
  {{{legstar-schemagen/index.html}COBOL Structures Mapping Generator}} to turn a COBOL code fragment into an XML Schema,
  LegStar proposes a contract-first approach with the {{{legstar-xsdcgen/index.html}Complex Types Mapping Generator}}.
  This tool takes a WSDL or XML Schema and automatically adds COBOL annotations to it.
  
  You can actually write new CICS programs and expose them as Web Services. LegStar fully supports the new
  CICS channel/container mechanism in addition to the standard commarea. LegStar supports multiple input
  containers and multiple output containers.
  
  LegStar also provides an API to allow CICS programs to {{{legstar-c2wsrt/index.html}Mainframe to Web Service runtime}}.
  
  In term of transport protocols to CICS, LegStar offers:
  
  * {{{legstar-csokrt/index.html}Socket Transport}}
  
  * {{{legstar-chttprt/index.html}HTTP Transport}}
  
  * {{{legstar-cmqrt/index.html}WebSphere MQ Transport}}

Use cases
  
  These are typical use cases for LegStar.

* Expose a CICS program as a Web Service

  <<Development steps:>>

  To fully Web Service enable a CICS program which input and output are described
  by COBOL fragments, you would follow these steps:
 
[images/legstar-dev-inbound.png] Development process

  <<Runtime architecture:>>

  From a runtime perspective, the architecture would be similar to this:
 
[images/legstar-run-inbound.png] Runtime process
  
* Execute a remote Web Service from a CICS program

  <<Development steps:>>

  To give a CICS program execute capabilities over a remote Web Service, you would
  follow these steps:
 
[images/legstar-dev-outbound.png] Development process

  <<Runtime architecture:>>

  From a runtime perspective, the architecture would be similar to this:
 
[images/legstar-run-outbound.png] Runtime process
